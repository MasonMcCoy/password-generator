# password-generator
Web application that generates random passwords based on user criteria.

Clicking the Generate Password button will trigger an event that will prompt the user to input a desired password length, follwed by four confirm messages to determine which characters types are to be used (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters). After the inputs have been validated, a random password populates the text area. New passwords can be seemlessly generated with additional clicks.
